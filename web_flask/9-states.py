Write a script that starts a Flask web application:

    Your web application must be listening on 0.0.0.0, port 5000
    You must use storage for fetching data from the storage engine
    (FileStorage or DBStorage) => from models import storage and
    storage.all(...)
    To load all cities of a State:
        If your storage engine is DBStorage, you must use cities
        relationship
        Otherwise, use the public getter method cities
    After each request you must remove the current SQLAlchemy Session:
        Declare a method to handle @app.teardown_appcontext
        Call in this method storage.close()
    Routes:
    /states: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
        H1 tag: “States”
        UL tag: with the list of all State objects present in DBStorage
        sorted by name (A->Z) tip
            LI tag: description of one
            State: <state.id>: <B><state.name></B>
    /states/<id>: display a HTML page: (inside the tag BODY)
        If a State object is found with this id:
            H1 tag: “State: ”
            H3 tag: “Cities:”
            UL tag: with the list of City objects linked to the State
            sorted by name (A->Z)
                LI tag: description of one
                City: <city.id>: <B><city.name></B>
        Otherwise:
            H1 tag: “Not found!”
    You must use the option strict_slashes=False in your route definition
    Import this 7-dump to have some data
